# gridview_transitions

Example illustrating the use of Hero, AnimatedPositioned and Flow widgets to animate transition of widgets in a grid.

Sometimes, you need to transition between two different kinds of grids in your app. For example, you have a grid of images and the user wants to see only the userâ€™s favorites. Some widgets may stay the same, while others change. How can you animate this transition, making existing widgets smoothly move and resize within the grid?
